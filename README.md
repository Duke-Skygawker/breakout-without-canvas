# Algorytmically draw blocks on the gameboard using Javascript and HTML

determined by blockQuantity array, 1= draws block, anything else, doesn't (in this case I used 0 to signal no block)

all dimensions can be changed in the index.js

![example screenshot for current blockQuantity](/draw%20blocks%20on%20the%20gameboard.png?raw=true "example screenshot")
